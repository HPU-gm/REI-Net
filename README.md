# REI-Net
code of Refined Enhancement and Integration Network for Real-Time Semantic Segmentation: Boosting Accuracy and Efficiency

# 1. Project name and introduction
Effective processing of multi-scale details, spatial information, and ensuring real-time performance are crucial challenges in semantic segmentation. To address these issues, we introduce the Refined Enhancement and Integration Network (REI-Net), which achieves high accuracy and efficiency in real-time semantic segmentation.
